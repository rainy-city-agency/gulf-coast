The used headset must be in good\n                working order with no exposed wires, cracks, obvious damage, or engravings, and original ear seals in\n                good condition. Any costs involved in repairing the headset or replacing ear seals will reduce the\n                trade-in value. Any non-repairable or unacceptable headset will be returned.",

If ordering online, please call Customer Service at <span id=\"spnPhone2\">863-709-9714<\/span> to obtain the Return Authorization.",

Once the headset\n                has been received and evaluated, you will receive a telephone call from our Sales Dept to help\n                you place your order for the new headset minus the trade-in value."
